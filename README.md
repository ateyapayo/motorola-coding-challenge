# Motorola Solutions - Coding Challenge by Andrea Piano

## Project Overview

Hi, fellow developers! I'm Andrea Piano, and that was my coding challenge that I developed for Motorola Solutions. In this coding challenge, my goal was to build a basic Angular 15 login page. It took me almost 3 hours. The login page includes essential functionalities such as user authentication, form validation, and navigation to a home upon successful login. The code submitted adheres to best practices, ensures a smooth user experience, and provides a solid foundation for future development. Itâ€™s important to note that this challenge is specifically focused on Front-end Developement, and there was no requirement to develop or submit any backend code.

## Notes & Considerations

- This was my first project developed using Angular 15, which I didn't find too difficult to develop, coming from solid fundamentals using React.js and simply having experience in Front-end Engineering. Also, the complexity of the tasks was definitely entry-level, and today I can claim to be more of a mid-level developer. However, I still have a lot to learn and improve, especially when it comes to Angular. Any feedback is welcome!
  (I helped myself by reading the official Angular 15 documentation, using Stack Overflow, Google, and watching YouTube tutorials.)

- I added some comments to my code where I felt it was necessary, so that other developers can never get lost in the code.

- Please read the entire README before running the application.

## Setup

Please begin by downloading this repo, or clone it by running the following command in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ateyapayo/motorola-assessment.git
```

### Installation

You will require NPM to run this project. Please install this before continuing.
You can find these here: https://nodejs.org/en/ .

Once you have NPM installed, please run the following command:

#### Client Setup

```
npm install
```

## Running the project

To run the project, you will need to simply run the client:

```
ng serve
```

This will start the Angular client application on port 4200.

## How to Sign In

To sign in to the form, simply enter the following credentials:

```
USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: 2023_Motorola
```

If the Sign In is successful, then you will be redirected to the home. This final destination, according to the assignment text, didn't need to show any content. Therefore I simply decorated the Angular Component initail message and left that as successful message.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Code scaffolding

In case you had to continue my work, run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Resources

- I downloaded the Motorola Solutions logo from the following link: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Motorola_M_symbol_black.svg .

- I developed the UI by getting inspired from the SIGN IN modal on the Motorola Solutions official website.

## Enjoy!
